# FaceRecognition

This module does face recognition based on embeddings. MTCNN is used to identify the faces. The FACENET model has been used for generating the image embeddings. Another single layer neural network is trained to compare the faces with existing faces(embeddings) in the database. This statistical modelling has a backdrop, so currently trying to fix it with a deep learning based classification technique for recognizing faces.
